 *  
 *  @brief Derived class of cell
 *
 *  @section DESCRIPTION
 *  
 *  Allocates additional cells after the grid has
 *    been initialized.
 *  
 *  When the memory-mapped region governed by MappedCell
 *    is full, Grid.h starts allocating AllocatedCells
 *    on the heap.
 *  
 *  This allows the grid to expand to a full size of
 *    220-by-220 as needed.
